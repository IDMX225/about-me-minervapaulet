# Color Scheme
This site uses a modern, tech-inspired color palette with deep backgrounds and vibrant accents. The color combinations were selected not only for visual appeal but also to meet color contrast and accessibility standards. Key interactive elements (like navigation links and buttons) feature high contrast colors for readability, especially for users with visual impairments.
