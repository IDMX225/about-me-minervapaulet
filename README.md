# Color Scheme
The color combinations were selected not only for visual appeal but also to meet color contrast and accessibility standards. Key interactive elements (like navigation links and buttons) feature high contrast colors for readability, especially for users with visual impairments.

| Purpose / Element                   | Color Example  | Hex Code  | RGB Value             |
|-------------------------------------|----------------|------------------------------------|
| **Main Background** (body)          | ![#5386E6]     | `#5386E6` | `rgb(83, 134, 230)`  |
| **Primary Text**                    | ![#3E043E]     | `#3E043E` | `rgb(62, 4, 62)`     |
| **Hero & Section Text**             | ![#012527]     | `#012527` | `rgb(1, 37, 39)`     |
| **Borders (Hero/Footer)**           | ![#013033]     | `#013033` | `rgb(1, 48, 51)`     |
| **Dropcap Accent**                  | ![#E8313A]     | `#E8313A` | `rgb(232, 49, 58)`   |
| **Highlight Violet** (Hover/Borders)| ![#6214FC]     | `#6214FC` | `rgb(98, 20, 252)`   |
| **Form & Button Accent**            | ![#40D3DE]     | `#40D3DE` | `rgb(64, 211, 222)`  |
| **Navbar Link Text**                | ![#A678FF]     | `#A678FF` | `rgb(166, 120, 255)` |

# Nav Bar
The navigation bar allows users to quickly jump to different sections of the page. It is fully responsive and styled using Flexbox and media queries to adapt across mobile, tablet, and desktop screen sizes.


| Element               | Color Example  | Hex Code  | Purpose                       |
| --------------------- | ---------------| --------- | ----------------------------- |
| **Navbar Background** | ![#013033]     | `#013033` | Deep teal for contrast        |
| **Link Text**         | ![#A678FF]     | `#A678FF` | Vibrant purple for visibility |
| **Link Hover**        | ![#6214FC]     | `#6214FC` | Violet hover accent           |
| **Hover Background**  | ![#40D3DE]     | `#40D3DE` | Teal background for feedback  |

### Accessibility
Keyboard Navigation: Links are accessible via Tab and show a visible hover/focus style.
Color Contrast: Ensured light text appears clearly against the dark background.
This nav bar ensures users can navigate efficiently while maintaining visual accessibility and design consistency.
