                    Hi, I’m Minerva Paulet, a passionate student and aspiring cybersecurity engineer based in New Jersey. 
                    I’m currently studying Computer Science and Networking, and I’m especially interested in digital forensics, ethical hacking, 
                    and protecting people online. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    My curiosity for technology started at a young age, but it truly took off once I realized how 
                    much good it could do when used to defend and inform others. I enjoy working in calm, focused environments, usually with some 
                    classical music playing and a cherry Pepsi by my side. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    I’m drawn to learning new things all the time, whether that’s through coursework, 
                    tutorials, or projects like this one. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    My long-term goal is to work in national security, contributing 
                    to a safer digital world. I’m also passionate about making tech more accessible and inclusive for others. Outside of school 
                    and tech, I’m someone who values kindness, growth, and meaningful connection. This site is a glimpse into who I am, and how 
                    I use both logic and creativity to build something meaningful.
                </p>

            <h2>Image Hover Effects</h2>
            <div>
                <h3>What is it?</h3>
                <p> Image hover effects are a type of animation in CSS that allow you to transform an image simply by hovering 
                    over it with your mouse. There are many kinds of hover effects you can apply. In my project, I implemented 
                    several styles including blur with text overlay, zoom and blur, slide-in effects from the left, right, top, 
                    and bottom combined with a blur. These effects add interactivity and visual appeal to a website, making the 
                    user experience more engaging. To the right I added some examples: 
                </p>
                <h3>How does it work?</h3>
                <p> The :hover pseudo-class is triggered when a user moves their cursor over an element, such as an image. 
                    A pseudo-class is used in CSS to define a special state of an element. In my project, I used :hover to apply 
                    various styles when an image is hovered over, but there are many other pseudo-classes available. For example, 
                    you can style visited and unvisited links differently (:visited, :link), style an element when it receives focus 
                    (:focus), style form elements based on their validation status (:valid, :invalid, :required, :optional) and much more.
                </p>

                <p> I used several CSS properties in my hover effects, including transform, filter, and opacity. The transform 
                    property allows you to rotate, scale, move, and skew elements, but in my case, images. The filter property 
                    enables you to apply visual effects like blur or grayscale. Additionally, the opacity property controls 
                    the transparency of an element, which is useful for creating fade-in and fade-out effects.
                </p>
                <h3>What are and how to use CSS Transitions?</h3>
                <p> CSS transitions are what let you change property values smoothly over a given duration. So, what that means is 
                    that it allows elements to gradually change from one style to another instead of happening instantly. For example, 
                    you can make a button slowly change color when hovered over, or make an image zoom in smoothly.
                </p>
                <h3>How are Image Hover Effects useful?</h3>
                <p> Hover effects are really helpful when it comes to making a website more interactive. They let users know that something 
                    on the page can be clicked or interacted with. For example, when you hover over a product and it zooms in or shows more 
                    info, that tells the user it’s important. It also makes the site look more modern and clean without using a lot of 
                    complicated code like JavaScript. Adding small effects like this keeps users more engaged and can make their experience 
                    on the site feel smoother and more fun.
                </p>
